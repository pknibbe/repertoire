## Things that impressed me or surprised me
* The kids are very comfortable using and messing around with the computers
* Can't really tell the girls apart from the boys
    * they both wear the same clothes 
    * ditto the hairstyles
    * many have gender-neutral names
* The staff don't worry about the computers getting messed up because they 
are re-imaged every night
* The staff have creative ideas and are very comfortable letting the kids 
goof around

## Now for the meat of the presentation. Scratch!(https://scratch.mit.edu/)

Feel free to create or access your own account. I'm going to demonstrate 
what I have learned in a few days since getting my account.

I go to my account indication and select my stuff. 
Then I click on it to load it.
[My Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/144682772/)   
Different things happen, depending on which key I press.

Click on See inside to see the scripting environment

Everything is built out of bricks from the scripts, Costumes, and Sounds
menu tabs.

* Select an image (called a Sprite) and decide what you want it to do.
* Select or upload a backdrop
* Choose some motion and sounds and events. 
* Mix them together on your own or use the tutorial.

## Why I'm Glad I'm Going
* This is a very accessible way to introduce kids to javascript. 
The next step would be to take a Scratch project and show kids the equivalent
javascript.
* I was able to help a couple of kids each night
* I've met interesting people (staff and volunteers)
* It's **fun!** :smile: :exclamation:
